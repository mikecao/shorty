# Shorty

Shorty is a simple URL shortener for PHP.

## Installation

1\. Download and extract the files to your web directory.

2\. Use the included `database.sql` file to create a table to hold your URLs.

3\. Configure your webserver.

For **Nginx**, add the following to your server declaration:

    server {
        location / {
            rewrite ^/(.*)$ /index.php?q=$1;
        }
    }

4\. Edit the `config.php` file.

## Generating short URLs

To generate a short URL, simply pass in a `url` query parameter to your Shorty installation:

    http://example.com/?url=http://www.google.com

This will return a shortened URL such as:

    http://example.com/9xq

When a user opens the short URL they will be redirected to the long URL location.

By default, Shorty will generate an HTML response for all saved URLs.
You can alter the response format by passing in a `format` query parameter.

    http://example.com/?url=http://www.google.com&format=text

The possible formats are `html`, `xml`, `text`, and `json`.

## Whitelist

By default anyone is allowed to enter a new URL for shortening. To restrict the saving of URLs to 
certain IP addresses, use the `allow` function:

    $shorty->allow('192.168.0.10');

## Requirements

* PHP 5.1+
* PDO extension
